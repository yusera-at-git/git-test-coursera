<!-- Checking out a file from an earlier commit
To check out the index.html from the second commit, find the number of the second commit using the git log, and then type the following at the prompt:
1 git checkout <second commit's number> index.html -->

<!-- To discard the effect of the previous operation and restore index.html to its state at the end of the third commit, type: -->
<!-- git reset HEAD index.html -->

<!-- Then type the following at the prompt: -->
<!-- git checkout -- index.html -->
<!-- You can also use git reset to reset the staging area to the last commit without disturbing the working directory. -->
